# Tic Tac Toe

A simple tic tac toe game made as part of [The Odin Project's curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-tic-tac-toe).

I attempted to follow Sandi Metz's 'rules' for OOP, alongside her extra rule of... don't follow the rules if there's good reason! (That includes getting mentally blocked, for me at least.)

I found writing to find the code frustrating and it drew out the process for me. I wrote this with the idea that I can add other games to main.rb in future, but I don't think I will. If I review this code, I would like to see:
- If there was a better way to store the variables, methods, or classes
- If there were clearer names I could have used to make it more readable
- A different algorithm to determine the winner
